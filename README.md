[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/btcsuite/btcd.png?branch=master)]
(https://travis-ci.org/btcsuite/btcd)

btcd is an alternative full node bitcoin implementation written in Go (golang).

This project is currently under active development and is in a Beta state.  It
is extremely stable and has been in production use for over 6 months as of May
2014, however there are still a couple of major features we want to add before
we come out of beta.

It properly downloads, validates, and serves the block chain using the exact
rules (including bugs) for block acceptance as Bitcoin Core.  We have taken
great care to avoid btcd causing a fork to the block chain.  It passes all of
the 'official' block acceptance tests
(https://github.com/TheBlueMatt/test-scripts) as well as all of the JSON test
data in the Bitcoin Core code.

It also relays newly mined blocks, maintains a transaction pool, and relays
individual transactions that have not yet made it into a block.  It ensures all
transactions admitted to the pool follow the rules required by the block chain
and also includes the same checks which filter transactions based on
miner requirements ("standard" transactions) as Bitcoin Core.

One key difference between btcd and Bitcoin Core is that btcd does *NOT* include
wallet functionality and this was a very intentional design decision.  See the
blog entry [here](https://blog.conformal.com/btcd-not-your-moms-bitcoin-daemon)
for more details.  This means you can't actually make or receive payments
directly with btcd.  That functionality is provided by the
[btcwallet](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcwallet) and
[btcgui](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcgui) projects which are both under
active development.

## Requirements

[Go](http://golang.org) 1.3 or newer.

## Installation

#### Windows - MSI Available

https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/releases

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Install Go according to the installation instructions here:
  http://golang.org/doc/install

- Ensure Go was installed properly and is a supported version:

```bash
$ go version
$ go env GOROOT GOPATH
```

NOTE: The `GOROOT` and `GOPATH` above must not be the same path.  It is
recommended that `GOPATH` is set to a directory in your home directory such as
`~/goprojects` to avoid write permission issues.

- Run the following command to obtain btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ go get -u github.com/btcsuite/btcd/...
```

- btcd (and utilities) will now be installed in either ```$GOROOT/bin``` or
  ```$GOPATH/bin``` depending on your configuration.  If you did not already
  add the bin directory to your system path during Go installation, we
  recommend you do so now.

## Updating

#### Windows

Install a newer MSI

#### Linux/BSD/MacOSX/POSIX - Build from Source

- Run the following command to update btcd, all dependencies, and install it:

```bash
$ go get -u -v github.com/btcsuite/btcd/...
```

## Getting Started

btcd has several configuration options avilable to tweak how it runs, but all
of the basic operations described in the intro section work with zero
configuration.

#### Windows (Installed from MSI)

Launch btcd from your Start menu.

#### Linux/BSD/POSIX/Source

```bash
$ ./btcd
````

## Issue Tracker

The [integrated github issue tracker](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/issues)
is used for this project.

## Documentation

The documentation is a work-in-progress.  It is located in the [docs](https://github.com/btcsuite/btcd/tree/master/docs) folder.

## GPG Verification Key

All official release tags are signed by Conformal so users can ensure the code
has not been tampered with and is coming from the btcsuite developers.  To
verify the signature perform the following:

- Download the public key from the Conformal website at
  https://opensource.conformal.com/GIT-GPG-KEY-conformal.txt

- Import the public key into your GPG keyring:
  ```bash
  gpg --import GIT-GPG-KEY-conformal.txt
  ```

- Verify the release tag with the following command where `TAG_NAME` is a
  placeholder for the specific tag:
  ```bash
  git tag -v TAG_NAME
  ```

      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must

          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
